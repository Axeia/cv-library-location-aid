# CV-Libray location aid
A javascript userscript for greasemonkey/tampermonkey/angrymonkey etc etc. It changes the location text on job pages to a hyperlink that leads to googlemaps.

CV-library is dark in the screen shot because I'm using my [dark mode theme](https://userstyles.world/style/4536/cv-library-dark-theme) for Stylus (Firefox/Chrome extension)
